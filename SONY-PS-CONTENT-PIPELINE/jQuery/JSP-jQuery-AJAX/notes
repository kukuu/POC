jQuery AJAX request and response example - Java Servlets, MySQL and JSON
Why not make AJAX request using plain JavaScript. Well guess what it's not programmer friendly, that's where all these JavaScript frameworks such as jQuery, 
ExtJs, Dojo etc. are good at. They encapsulate a lot of the underlying technology and provide us programmers with clean
 API's that has lot of config options and event triggers to handle anything from a simple form submit to something more complicated.

The method for AJAX request is jQuery.ajax( url [, settings] )
The $.ajax() method returns the jqXHR object. URL is a string containing the URL to which the request is sent and 
settings are a set of key/value pairs that configure the Ajax request. All settings are optional.
